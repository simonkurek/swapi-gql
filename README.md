## Description

SWAPI-GQL is a GraphQL wrapper for the Star Wars API (SWAPI). It is built using NestJS and Apollo Server.
Additionally, it uses Postgres to cache data (because of SWAPI long response times) what gives additional opportunity to get gql nested data.

## Architecture Design

### Description

App has 3 layers.
Each layer is a separate module.
API is handling all GQL staff.
Core is handling all application logic - uses infrastructure layer to get data.
Infrastructure is handling all data related stuff - uses swapi to get data or repositories to get and save data to database.

## Todo

- [ ] Add tests
- [x] Add caching
- [x] Cache check
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] Types for swapi, domain, gql, typeorm
- [ ] Nested gQL queries

### API

Api is built using GQL and Apollo Server.
